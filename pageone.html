      <h1>High Fashion</h1>


      <p>
        High fashion, also known as haute couture, is characterized by extremely unique clothing designs, high cost, high-quality fabrics, unique designs, and jewelry embellishments. These clothing are hand-made by experts, most often, to the wearer specifications. They are mostly sold as one-offs or in extremely limited quantities.

        As mentioned, they are very unique It is not the kind of fashion that you see around every other time. To get a see this high fashion clothing, you have to appear at the runway or contact the designers for a custom made order. Often times, high fashion sets the trend for low fashion.

        Think of high fashion as clothing made by luxury fashion houses like Dolce and Gabbana, Armani, Gucci, and the likes. These fashion design houses create the designs and market through high-end fashion runways like the Paris fashion week, New York fashion week among others.

       Most of these fashion houses are based in Uk, Paris, and Italy. It is safe to say they are based in Europe although with outlets in major cities in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a fashion house to qualify as a high fashion label, they must have showcased their collection at any one of the four major fashion weeks- Paris, New York, Milan, and London. The collection must have at least 35 runs with both daytime and evening outfits.
