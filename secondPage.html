    <h1>Low Fashion</h1>

    <p>
    Low fashion is basically the cheap mass-produced fashions. The target market for low fashion is the consumers who want to look trendy but not willing to part with a lot of money just for a single item. Surprisingly their consumers are the largest compared to high fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
    Often times, these items are replicas of what you see on the runways and in the big high-end fashion stores.
    </p>
    <p>
    Low fashion is pretty fast in the essence that the styles hit and leave the streets in record time. They become popular for just a short while and boom, all pieces are gone and so is the style. Hence the name fast fashion.
