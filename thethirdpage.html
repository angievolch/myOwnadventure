     <h1>Fast Fashion</h1>

     <p>
     Fast fashion has been a mainstay of popular culture for decades. From the fabulously wealthy to the wannabe millionaire with expensive taste, people rely on trendy clothing that is accessible to all. But a recent increase in the rate at which we cycle through trends has sparked concern: particularly among the TikTok-loving, newly minted environmental advocates of the younger generation.

     Looking back, rising levels of globalization and offshore manufacturing in the 90s led to the development of unsustainable fast fashion as we know it today, a chic, flashy beast, fashioned from inhumane conditions and gargantuan contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. That being said, overconsumption is not an entirely modern issue. In fact, calls for sustainable fashion have been around since the flower power movement of the 60s, but the term “slow fashion” was coined as recently as 2013, following the disastrous Rana Plaza collapse.

     What sets this past year apart in fashion history, however, is the tremendous upswing in the speed at which we are cycling through trends.

     Social media rise in popularity over the past decade has produced a world divided into the influencers and the influenced. Visual sites like Instagram, Pinterest and, most recently, TikTok, feature a plethora of visual imagery that users can emulate.
